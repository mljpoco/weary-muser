    body: 'On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.'

      'Being satisfied with an answer has little to do with having arrived at a logically acceptable conclusion — and more to do with the merciful cessation of an intellectual dissection whose inertia would otherwise carry it out indefinitely. Parents (re-) learn this when their children come to be about four years old, and enter the proverbial <em>Why Phase</em>. The Why Phase is regarded as everything from cute, to remarkable, to mind-numbingly frustrating — but always as something out of which every functional person is expected to grow.<br><br>The completely natural phenomenon of the Why Phase never actually leaves the brain, however. A quick test will reveal it’s simply tucked under the surface, <em>just</em> beneath the veil of personality. You start with any explanation, and find that without much struggle — the question, “why?”, can be asked in perfectly good faith until you run out of language. It’s interesting that we acknowledge this natural inquisitive capacity to be so unwieldy that it’s of imperative social necessity to relegate its verbal manifestation to little more than youth and/or isolation — but at the same time we demand its exercise whenever anything of importance is being discussed.<br><br>At the very best this is a hilarious contradiction to watch unfold if you’re bearing witness to an argument between two people who’ve forgotten there are no coordinates to the bottom of the rabbit hole, and at the worst — it gets people ostracized and persecuted. When we treat logical analysis as an end in itself in the theatre of decision-making as it pertains to large groups especially, one half of what makes us fundamentally human is swept under the rug and stamped out. The terms to describe that half usually take on names like intuition, common sense, social-graces, etc. All the things of importance when the glue that holds people together is what’s at stake.<br><br>I love a clean, logical process of thinking and explaining phenomena just as much as the next person, but trying to make it the holy grail to which all should aspire on every front is suggesting that the tail should wag the dog. A car’s engine does not exist for its own sake save for in special environments dedicated to its bleeding edge expression. Similarly, intellectual prowess has its domain, and it’s imperative that the Why Phase <em>continue</em> to be siphoned accordingly — just as much because of what deleterious potential it can possess, as because the promise it holds is too valuable to be squandered in settings where it isn’t welcome.<br><br> When the world’s thinkers have no direction — they mold and carve their surroundings to taste. The intellect is too corrosive for this to happen uncoordinated for any length of time with the expectation that the integral structures of the society hosting it might remain uninjured. We must allow and encourage our thinkers to have their spaces, or be ready to continue riding waves of cultural upheaval as they arrive.'

      'His every act is in perfect accordance with his conscious will. He is never rushed, but also never quite idle. There is a transcendent calmness about him which comforts and reassures every being he comes into contact with. His patience is impenetrable, and his discipline as consistent and unwavering as the cycles of the universe. He is measured, but not anxious — supremely peaceful, but never lazy. When he makes a mistake, he corrects himself swiftly and gently, taking care to sow no further discord in his environment or in himself. It\'s as though he experiences his entire life as a lucid dream — infinitely aware, so that the only tension which ever beseiges him is that which he is keen to invite upon himself.'
